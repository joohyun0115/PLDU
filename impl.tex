%Paragraph 1: 커널 버전 및 코드 분량, 테스트에 대한 설명
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
We implemented the new deferred update algorithm in Linux 4.5.rc6 kernel, and
our modified Linux is available as open source. 
global queue를 사용한 버전일 경우 코드의 수정량은 xx-xx을 가지며 덜 복잡한 구조이며, 
percore를 사용할 경우 코드 수정량은 xx-xx을 가진다.

%Paragraph 2: per-core queue 구현에 대한 설명 
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

LDU percore queue는 2가지 방법으로 구현되었다. 
첫번째 방법은 percore hash table로 구현하는 방법이다.
percore hash table 방법은 direct-mapped cache 처럼 구현하여, 버켓에는 하나의 object만 존재하도록
만든 방법이다. 
만약 hash 충돌이 발생하면 기존 해당 코어의 log를 flush하는 일을 수행한다.
이것은 file reverse mapping 처럼 object가 많이 생기지 않을 때 유용하다. 
이 방법은 기존 코드에 대한 수정없이 적용이 가능하고 추가적인 lock이 필요없다.
하지만 이 방법은 anonymous reverse mapping 처럼 object가 많이 생기는 경우, hash 충돌로 인해 
성능상 오버헤드가 생긴다. 
따라서 anonymous reverse mapping의 percore queue는 percore data에 object별로
구분하지 않고 로그를 저장한 후 실제 percore log를 수행할 때 global lock을 사용하여 보호하였다.

%\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
%We implemented the new deferred update algorithm in Linux 3.19.rc4 kernel, and
%our modified Linux is available as open source.
%\deferu's scheme is based on deferred processing, so it needs a garbage
%collector for delayed free.
%In order to implement the garbage collector, we use the lock-less list and a
%periodic timer(1 sec) in the Linux.

%Paragraph 2: 문제점을 해결하기 위해 Harris linked list를 적용
%We compare our \deferu implementation to a concurrent non-blocking Harris
%linked list ~\cite{Harris2001Lockfree};therefore, we implement the Harris
%% linked list to Linux kernel.
%The code refers from sysnchrobench~\cite{Gramoli2015Synchrobench} and
%ASCYLIB~\cite{David2015ASYNCHRONIZED}, and we convert their linked list to
%Linux kernel style.
%Because both synchrobench and ASCYLIB leak memory, we implement additional
%garbage collector for the Linux kernel using Linux's work queues and lock-less
%list.

%Paragraph 3: 오브젝트의 특징을 고려한 lock-free list 구현 
%In order to further improve performance, we move their ordered list to
%unordered list. 
%A feature of the Harris linked list is all the nodes are ordered by
%their key. 
%Zhang~\cite{zhang2013practical} implements a lock-free unordered list
%algorithm, whose list is each insert and remove operation appends an
%intermediate node at the head of the list;these approach is practically
%hard to implement.
%Indeed, Linux does not require contains operation because the Linux data
%structures such as list, tree and hash table not depended on search key;they
%depend on their unique object.
%This feature can eliminates the ordered list in Harris linked list.
%Therefore, we perform each insert operation appends an intermediate node at
%the first node of the list;on the other hand, each remove operation searches
%from head to their node.

%Paragraph 4: mapping은 DeferU와 Harris linked 리스트 둘 다 적용, 
%하지만 anon은 Harris Lined list 만 적용과 이유
%To the scalability of fork, the reverse mapping's lock contention should
%be eliminated not only from file reverse mapping but also from anonymous
% reverse mapping.
%The structure of file reverse mapping is simplified relatively to the
%structure of anonymous mapping because the anonymous reverse mapping is
%entangled by their global object(\code{anon\_vma}) and their
%chain(\code{anon\_vma\_chain});therefore, we only apply \deferu to file reverse
%mapping.
